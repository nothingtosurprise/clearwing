"""Unified Finding type for clearwing.

One dataclass that can represent every finding shape in the project:
    - network-pentest findings from CICDRunner
    - file-level findings from SourceAnalyzer (static regex/AST)
    - source-hunt findings from the sourcehunt pipeline

Backwards-compat converters let every existing caller keep using its own
dict/dataclass shape — the Finding type is additive. Internal refactors can
move to it incrementally.
