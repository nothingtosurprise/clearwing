"""Independent-context verifier agent for sourcehunt findings.

The verifier takes a single Finding from a hunter and decides whether
it's real. v0.1 uses a non-adversarial prompt; v0.2 turns on the adversarial
mode where the verifier is required to steel-man both sides. v0.3 adds an
optional patch-oracle truth test — write a minimal defensive fix, recompile,
re-run the PoC. If the crash disappears the root cause theory is causally
validated; if it survives, the theory is suspect and should bounce back to
the hunter.

Independence: the verifier never sees the hunter's reasoning messages. Only
the finding dict and the file content. This is enforced at the orchestration
level (the runner builds a fresh agent per finding).
