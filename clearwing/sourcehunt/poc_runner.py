"""PoC replay — the sandbox leg of the verify-by-recompile gate.

Given a finding, a candidate diff, and a running SandboxContainer, this
module applies the diff, rebuilds the target, re-runs the PoC input, and
returns True/False for "crash still happens."

This is the load-bearing primitive for:
    - Verifier.run_patch_oracle (v0.3 truth test)
    - AutoPatcher.attempt        (v0.3 mandatory verify-by-recompile gate)

Design constraints:
    - NEVER modify the host repo. The diff is applied inside /scratch, and
      the sandbox is already configured with a read-only /workspace mount.
    - Fail closed: any error during apply/build/run counts as "crash still
      happens" (conservative — don't falsely validate a broken patch).
    - Bounded: every step has a timeout.
