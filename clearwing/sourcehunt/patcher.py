"""Auto-Patch mode — minimal defensive fixes for verified critical/high findings.

Runs after the Exploiter on findings that reached `evidence_level >=
root_cause_explained` and `severity in {critical, high}`. The patcher agent
writes a minimal fix diff, optionally applies it in a sandbox, re-runs the
PoC, and returns a PatchAttempt record. A passed attempt bumps the finding
to `patch_validated`.

**The verify-by-recompile gate is mandatory.** When no sandbox is available
(or no rerun_poc callback is supplied), the patcher operates in "LLM-only"
mode and records `validated=False` — unverified patch suggestions are never
marked as validated.

A candidate patch that PASSES validation is included in the report as a
suggestion. Optionally, `--auto-pr` opens a draft PR via the `gh` CLI.

PATCHER_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are writing a PRODUCTION-QUALITY minimal fix for a verified critical or high-severity vulnerability.

Unlike the patch-oracle pass (which writes quick truth-test fixes), this patch MUST be:

1. Correct — actually eliminates the vulnerability, not just the immediate crash.
2. Minimal — smallest change that fixes the bug without touching unrelated code.
3. Defensive — preserves existing behavior for safe inputs.
4. Consistent with the file's existing style (indentation, naming, comment style).
5. Accompanied by a 1-3 sentence commit message explaining the fix.

The fix MUST NOT:
- Add dependencies on new libraries.
- Change the public API.
- Rewrite the function.
- Delete the vulnerable code path entirely (unless it's truly dead).

Return ONLY a JSON object:
